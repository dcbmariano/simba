 GlimmerHMM-3.0.1.tar.gz = added trainings for zebrafish and C.elegans

 GlimmerHMM-3.0.0.tar.gz = introduced the possibility of predicting more than the top scoring prediction; introduced the possibility to use protein domains to improve prediction; improved the start and stop site detection modules; introduced the possibility to output gff file

 GlimmerHMM-2.2.0.tar.gz = changed trainGlimmerHMM to have the possibility to specify the training directory name at running with option -d

 GlimmerHMM-2.1.4.tar.gz = small error correction in procedure printgene from trainGlimmerHMM

 GlimmerHMM-2.1.3.tar.gz = updated the procedure calcfalse from dectree_allinfo.pm

 GlimmerHMM-2.1.2.tar.gz = updated the comp procedure from qsort in training directory.

 GlimmerHMM-2.1.0.tar.gz = updated the human train directory; the software code has been modified to accomodate multiple overlapping gene predictions 

 GlimmerHMM-2.0.4.tar.gz = updated Rice train directory;
