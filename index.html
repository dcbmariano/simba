<p>SIMBA, SImple Manager for Bacterial Assemblies, is a Web interface for managing various processes of assembly of bacterial genomes.
Simba was created to assist bioinformaticians to assemble bacterial genomes sequenced with next-generation platforms (NGS) quickly, easily and effectively.</p>

<h2>
<a name="why-use-simba" class="anchor" href="#why-use-simba"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why use SIMBA?</h2>

<p>SIMBA allows bioinformaticians do not worry so much about techniques with repetitive activities and focus on the most important: understand and analyze biological questions!
Mounts genomes using processes with a high degree of complexity that adopt heuristics to attempt to obtain results closer to the biological reality. Soon, dozens of software is required for completion of all assembly processes.</p>

<p>Thus, to realize a fitting is required, in addition to knowledge of the biological part, a large knowledge of operating system and the specific operation of each software. Which leads to a slow learning curve!</p>

<p>In addition, many repetitive processes could be reduced with the adoption of automation scripts, which controlled graphical interface, accelerate the process of data processing, assembly and curation.</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-simba-works" class="anchor" href="#how-simba-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How SIMBA works?</h2>

<p>SIMBA runs on the Web! Can be run through any browser on any operating system.
SIMBA runs even cellular phones.
SIMBA is a wrapper, that integrates multiple tools into a single interface that can be accessed through a browser.</p>
