{"name":"SIMBA","tagline":"SImple Manager for Bacterial Assemblies","body":"# What is SIMBA?\r\n\r\nSIMBA, SImple Manager for Bacterial Assemblies, is a Web interface for managing various processes of assembly of bacterial genomes.\r\nSimba was created to assist bioinformaticians to assemble bacterial genomes sequenced with next-generation platforms (NGS) quickly, easily and effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why use SIMBA?\r\nSIMBA allows bioinformaticians do not worry so much about techniques with repetitive activities and focus on the most important: understand and analyze biological questions!\r\nMounts genomes using processes with a high degree of complexity that adopt heuristics to attempt to obtain results closer to the biological reality. Soon, dozens of software is required for completion of all assembly processes.\r\n\r\nThus, to realize a fitting is required, in addition to knowledge of the biological part, a large knowledge of operating system and the specific operation of each software. Which leads to a slow learning curve!\r\n\r\nIn addition, many repetitive processes could be reduced with the adoption of automation scripts, which controlled graphical interface, accelerate the process of data processing, assembly and curation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How SIMBA works?\r\nSIMBA runs on the Web! Can be run through any browser on any operating system.\r\nSIMBA runs even cellular phones.\r\nSIMBA is a wrapper, that integrates multiple tools into a single interface that can be accessed through a browser.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
